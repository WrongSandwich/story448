It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.

I've never understood this quote, it seems to contradict itself. I guess I should probably read A Tale of Two Cities?

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring ofhope, it was the winter of despair...

Wow okay this quote is actually long af I had no idea
